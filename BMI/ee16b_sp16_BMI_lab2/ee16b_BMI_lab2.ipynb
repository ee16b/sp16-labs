    "The ability to convert from the time domain to the frequency domain is a crucial skill in signal processing because while some data might not look particularly useful in the time domain, seeing it in the frequency domain may shed some insight. The analysis of brain waves is a real world application of this domain conversion; researchers have been able to tie brain activity to the actual movement of a primate using complciated analysis in the freqeuncy domain. In this lab we will do some simple analysis of our own to predict some basic actions performed by a subject through looking at its brain signals in frequency domain."
