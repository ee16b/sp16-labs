    "Last week we built a cascade of 3 amplifiers - an instrumentation amplifier and 2 non-inverting amplifiers. The first task of this lab is to test each amplifier and make sure its still work as expected. This is a crucial step - wires might come lose after a breadborad was thrown in a backpack, or a mistake may have been made when hooking the circuit back up to all of the instruments. It's a good idea to test a circuit before building any more parts.\n",

    "One thing you might have noticed in last week's lab is a 60 Hz signal appearing from time to time - this is caused by noise in our power supply. In the US, wall power is supplied at an AC frequency of 60Hz. Even the best DC power supply lets through some of this AC signal into its DC output. We can fix this with a couple of capacitors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall how capacitors behave: they \"ignore,\" or short, high frequency signals. This is perfect to help remove the 60 Hz noise by directing the AC noise on the rails to ground, but maintaining the DC voltage of rails.\n",
    "<b>Add a $1\\mu F$ capacitor between your power supply rails (5V & -5V) and the ground rails</b> (a total of 2 caps). The figure below might prove useful. (Note: only 2 capacitors are shown in this figure but you'll need to add one capacitor between 5V and -5V.)\n",
