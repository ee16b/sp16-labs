    "Welcome to the second module - Front End! In the first module, we learned how the brain wave data we record can be used to predict the behavior of the subject, but what we didn't discuss was how we take an analog signal (something in the real world) and translate it into a digital signal (something stored in a computer). The diagram below shows a simple setup for an Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) and a Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC).\n",

    "\n",
    "In this lab, we will focus on going from an analog signal to a digital one using our Launchpads as an ADC. The ADC uses the process of sampling to discretize the data, allowing us to store individual points rather than a continuous wave. As was (or shortly will be) discussed in lecture, this process can cause certain problems (aliasing, etc), but we won't worry about them for now.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal in this module is to build the <b>Signal Conditioning</b> block in the top row above. Although the voltages we get from the brain are analog signals, they are very <i>very</i> small, usually in the order of ~1$\\mu$V. We need to provide some amplification and filtering such that our signal is within the acceptable range for our ADC input. The block diagram of the circuit we will implement in this module is shown below.\n",

We will also try using both sinusoids and a simulated Local Field Potential (LFP) BMI signal from the first BMI lab to explore how real-world conditions can cause added complications.\n",
    "\n",
    "This week, we will build a set of amplifiers that we will slowly build up from as we encounter different issues. <b>As you can see above, the circuit we will be building is quite complicated. Please try to be very neat and plan ahead in your breadboard layout.</b> It is best to start at one edge of the breadboard and work inward to ensure there is enough space for all of the different blocks.\n",
