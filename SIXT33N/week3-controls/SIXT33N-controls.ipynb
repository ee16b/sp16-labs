    "In this phase you will first build SIXT33N's chassis and the sensors (wheel encoders) and actuators (motor drivers). You will also power the car up using a 9V rechargeable battery. Next, you will model the the car as an open loop system. You will gather some dynamics data to figure out the variables in your model, and lastly build a closed loop controller. By the end of the phase, you should be able to control the trajectory of the car, which will be integrated with the other components of the project in the last phase. As a reminder, your car has to be able to turn and go straight at different speeds. If you want to implement more complicated controls, go for it!\n",

    "## Battery and Voltage Regulator\n",
    "\n",
    "You probably do not want to try to power SIXT33N off your laptop and run around with a long cord chasing it. Thus, <b>you will run the car off of two 9V batteries</b>. You will use one of the batteries exclusively for the motors, and the other for powering the Launchpad and microphone front end. The reason for this is that the motors consume a lot of current, but the current is not constant, in fact, it is very noisy. If we were to use the same voltage source for the Launchpad and the motors, the Launchpad would restart everytime the motors pulled too much current. Note that the ground is still all connected (i.e. the grounds of the two batteries are connected). The whole power distribution is shown in the diagram below. The front end circuit will use both the regulator output and the Launchpad's 3.3V pin.\n",

The <a href=\"http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/lm340-n.pdf\">LM34015</a> is a voltage regulator that outputs around 5V. Glance through the datasheet (figure 6) to find the pin diagram. <b>First, connect the input $V_{in}$ to 9V from the bench power source</b>. Don't forget to connect the ground of the regulator to the rail you want to be ground. Add 2 $10 \\mu F$ capacitors as in the schematic below. These will help decrease noise even further.\n",

First, take the power supply off the voltage regulator. <b>Never connect both the power source and the battery at the same time. Don't do it.</b> Use the middle pin of the switch and one of the edge pins to connect the 9V battery lead to the voltage regulator input. The opposite edge pin should remain unconnected. The ground of the 9V battery lead should go to the ground rail of the circuit. Also, remember, that your battery leads should have a knot in them if you haven't done that already.\n",

    "## Motor Drivers\n",
    "To be able to move, the car needs motor drivers. The DC motors we use are usually driven by a Pulse Width Modulated (PWM) signal which will be produced by the Launchpad. A PWM signal is simply a square wave at a certain frequency but with variable duty cycle (percentage time the signal is high in a period). Since the motors need a lot of power, as mentioned before, we will connect the motors to their own separate 9V battery and use an NPN transistor control whether the motor is powered or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "The NPN BJT behaves a little different from the NMOS you are familiar with. Both transistors can still be considered switch-like. An NMOS uses voltage to control whether the switch is off or on, but a BJT uses current to control the switch. When the Launchpad outputs a 0V, there is no current flowing into the base (BJT equvalent of gate) so the BJT does not allow current to flow through the motor. When the Launchpad outputs a logical high (3.3V), current is allowed to flow through the base and turn the motor on. However, BJTs can be burned by running too much current through them, so a $2K\\Omega$ resistor is used to limit the current. \n",

If the voltage in the anode is higher than the cathode (see diagram below), it will conduct current from the anode to the cathode and behave somewhat like a closed switch. However, if the voltage in the anode is lower than the cathode, it does not conduct current and behaves like an open switch. This diode is needed because of the inductive behavior of the motor. If we do not add this diode, we risk harming the BJT. The diagram for the diode is shown below. Note that the diode has a direction - be careful which terminal is attached to the 9V power supply.\n",
